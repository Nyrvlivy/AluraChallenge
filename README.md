## Project Description

This project is a **Java RESTful API**, built with **Spring Boot**, aimed at managing the educational platform provided by Alura Challenge. It allows for user authentication, course management, user enrollments, and course ratings. Integrated with Swagger for API documentation, this robust platform facilitates educational management and enhances the learning experience.

##
